# BDUI CLI Simplification Plan

## Objectives
- Replace ad-hoc project wiring with a first-class `bdui` CLI that exposes `run` and `init` commands.
- Ensure sample apps (e.g., `react-sample`) and downstream consumers only need `bdui run` to execute tests.
- Keep BDUI-required behavior intact while allowing safe user customization.

## Key Requirements
1. **Single command test execution**: `bdui run` handles config loading, step registration, and cucumber invocation.
2. **New CLI binary**: Implemented inside the `behavior-driven-ui` package, exported via existing `bin` field.
3. **Bundled core steps**: Users never copy BDUI-provided steps; CLI always registers them automatically.
4. **Centralized runtime orchestration**: Logic currently in `apps/react-sample/cucumber.ts` migrates into the CLI.
5. **Extensible steps**: Users may add step files by convention (e.g., `bdui/steps/**/*.{ts,js}`) or by providing globs in config.
6. **Protected cucumber options**: Users may supply overrides, but CLI validates/filters them to avoid conflicts with BDUI requirements.
7. **Project scaffolding**: `bdui init` creates baseline directories, config, and scripts idempotently (“schafoled”) to prep projects.

## Implementation Outline
- **CLI Structure**
  - Use `commander` for command parsing.
  - Support `bdui run [options]` invoking `runBduiFeatures` with merged defaults.
  - Support `bdui init` to generate config, directories, and optional sample files.
  - Handle TS/ESM loading (register `tsx`/loaders) before importing user steps.
- **Configuration**
  - Introduce `bdui.config.(ts|js)` schema (validated with `zod`).
  - Defaults: `features/**/*.feature`, `bdui/steps/**/*.{ts,js}`.
  - Allow explicit cucumber options but sanitize conflicting fields (e.g., keep `strict`, enforce core loaders).
- **Step Loading**
  - Always register BDUI core step library.
  - Discover additional steps via conventions or config globs and require/import them dynamically.
- **Sample App Updates**
  - Remove `apps/react-sample/cucumber.ts` and related scripts.
  - Replace test script with `bdui run`.
  - Provide scaffolded files generated by `bdui init` (or document how to regenerate).
- **Build & Packaging**
  - Update `tsup.config.ts` to emit CLI bundle (`dist/cli.js` + `.mjs`).
  - Ensure package exports/binaries reference compiled output.
- **Documentation & Tests**
  - Add docs covering CLI usage, init workflow, configuration reference, migration notes.
  - Add unit/integration tests verifying CLI commands, config merging, and step discovery.

## Execution Rules
- **Status icons**: 🔴 Not started · 🟡 In progress · 🟢 Done
- At any time, **only one step may be marked 🟡**. When we start a step, mark it 🟡 and keep all others at 🟢 (if already approved) or 🔴.
- A step may be marked 🟢 only after explicit user approval.
- Every step must begin with validation commands (`git status`, `turbo build`, `turbo test`) and end with (`turbo build`, `turbo test`, `git status`).
- Each step’s change must remain small and individually reviewable; tests are added as soon as a step can be tested.

## Implementation Plan

1. 🔴 **Introduce Test Runner Dependencies**
   - Pre-check: `git status`; `turbo build`; `turbo test`.
   - Change: add Vitest dependencies, workspace test scripts, and a Vitest config stub so the package can execute unit tests.
   - Post-check: `turbo build`; `turbo test`; `git status`.
   - Tests to add: minimal passing Vitest smoke test (e.g., `expect(true).toBe(true)`) proving the runner works.

2. 🔴 **Baseline CLI Entry Skeleton**
   - Pre-check guardrails.
   - Change: add minimal `src/cli/index.ts` plus placeholder types/options; include empty (skipped) CLI-related test file to be filled later.
   - Post-check guardrails.
   - Tests to add: none yet (placeholder remains skipped until actual behavior exists).

3. 🔴 **Initial CLI Smoke Test**
   - Pre-check guardrails.
   - Change: flesh out the placeholder test to verify the CLI entry loads without throwing (e.g., invoking `bdui --help`).
   - Post-check guardrails.
   - Tests to add: the smoke test itself executed via `pnpm --filter behavior-driven-ui run test`.

4. 🔴 **Hook CLI into Build Outputs**
   - Pre-check guardrails.
   - Change: update `tsup.config.ts`, package `bin` field, and exports to emit compiled CLI artifacts.
   - Post-check guardrails.
   - Tests to add: extend Vitest coverage to assert tsup config contains the CLI entry or run a bundling smoke test if feasible.

5. 🔴 **Configuration Loader & Validation**
   - Pre-check guardrails.
   - Change: implement config discovery (`bdui.config.*`) with zod validation and defaults.
   - Post-check guardrails.
   - Tests to add: unit tests covering valid config, missing config fallback, and schema validation errors.

6. 🔴 **Step Discovery Utilities**
   - Pre-check guardrails.
   - Change: implement functions to resolve step files via conventions/globs without executing them.
   - Post-check guardrails.
   - Tests to add: unit tests using temp directories verifying glob behavior and deduplication.

7. 🔴 **TypeScript/ESM Loader Registration**
   - Pre-check guardrails.
   - Change: add module that registers `tsx` (or similar) once before loading user steps to support TS/ESM files.
   - Post-check guardrails.
   - Tests to add: unit test to ensure loader runs once; integration test proving a TS step file can be imported.

8. 🔴 **Implement `bdui run` Command**
   - Pre-check guardrails.
   - Change: wire CLI run command to load config, register core steps, load user steps, sanitize cucumber options, and invoke `runBduiFeatures`.
   - Post-check guardrails.
   - Tests to add: Vitest suite mocking `runBduiFeatures` verifying option merging, enforced defaults, and failure handling.

9. 🔴 **Implement `bdui init` Command**
   - Pre-check guardrails.
   - Change: add scaffolding command creating config/feature/step directories idempotently.
   - Post-check guardrails.
   - Tests to add: integration test running CLI in a temp directory verifying created files and safe re-runs.

10. 🔴 **Update `react-sample` to Use CLI**
    - Pre-check guardrails.
    - Change: remove `cucumber.ts`, update scripts to call `bdui run`, and include CLI-generated scaffolding artifacts if applicable.
    - Post-check guardrails.
    - Tests to add: ensure existing cucumber scenarios run via CLI by executing `pnpm --filter react-sample run test` in an integration test.

11. 🔴 **Repository-Level Integration Smoke Test**
    - Pre-check guardrails.
    - Change: add automated smoke test (in `apps/react-sample` or new fixture) invoking compiled `bdui run` end-to-end.
    - Post-check guardrails.
    - Tests to add: the smoke test wired into turbo `test` pipeline.

12. 🔴 **Documentation Refresh**
    - Pre-check guardrails.
    - Change: update docs/README to explain new CLI, config, and migration path.
    - Post-check guardrails.
    - Tests to add: none (documentation change only; rely on lint if available).

13. 🔴 **Final Verification & Cleanup**
    - Pre-check guardrails.
    - Change: none—resolve TODOs, ensure clean git state, prep summary for review.
    - Post-check guardrails.
    - Tests to add: none (just verification).
